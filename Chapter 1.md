## § 1. The Explanatory Inquiry of the Predefined Terms of the Meaning of Being in General

In what follows we shall treat the terms used in our foregoing exposition of being in general, and what is used in such terms. The precise manner in which being is defined in the sense of its being is not crucial for the feasibility of our interpretation. The definition is not a technicality, but is a fundamental insight into the ground of the possible ground of the being of beings, a ground that is continually to be clarified. Our definition of being is not a mere codification of an otherwise valid ontological concept.

In the following discussion we shall endeavor to present the existential meaning of being in the broadest sense possible, that is, to bring to a consideration the being that we ourselves in each case are. The being that we ourselves in each case are is the there. It is "there" in a way that is our own and for which we have made a definite set of existential and ontological assumptions. The way in which the being we ourselves in each case are is not an externalisation of an existentiell relation of being, but the way in which we ourselves in each case are in that relation. We are the there because we ourselves have to be in order for it to be. The being that we ourselves in each case are has to be something that we ourselves are not and can never be. If it were not for this, beings in each case would have to be "there" for us. And we are, after all, these beings. We can never be them.

We are not the they. The they is not a concrete social relation, an objectively present "subject." The they is a relation. "We" do not exist objectively in such a way that we are the they. "We" are not a relation either when we are, after all, these beings, but a being which, as a being, belongs to the being of each of them. And the being which we ourselves in each case are is not a relation in the sense of an objectively present "object."

The being of these beings is not just another "relation." Like other "relations," "reified" being is not a relation between two objectively present things at all, but it is the ground of a relation between beings. The relation between beings "only" has the character of a relation because it is capable of such a relation itself, but it is not an objectively present thing. The relation with which we are able to be objectively present is that between what we call bodies [Seienden] and what we call persons (the "public"), that is, in regard to the being [Sein] of the beings encountered within the world.

The meaning of the fundamental ontological condition for the possibility of the existence of the "there" lies in the constitution of the disclosedness of the there. It is not an "externalization" of an existing being, but is rather the disclosedness of the being to which the being disclosed in the articula tion of the being of Dasein belongs. The self-contained disclosedness of the there is its there. And only because the disclosedness of the there is a there and does not "dissipate" it in its being, is this being also disclosed to beings as such. As Dasein, Dasein is its disclosedness.

The disclosedness of the there is constituted by attunement (guilt). Attunement, which is "connected" with guilt in the sense of the existential condition of the possibility of the existentiell possibility of Dasein, is not a way in which the "there" is disclosed, but is a disclosedness of the there. This is evident in the fact that when Dasein "makes" something known, it does not in any way intend to cover up its "guilt." It is the disclosedness of the there that makes this known. The there is disclosed in such a way that the "there" is illuminated, that is, the there is disclosed in the "luminosity" of the they. Lightness, brightness, and brightness are constitutive of the "there." We have already characterized this expression in an earlier passage. It stands for the thing itself. It has the meaning of illumination, of the visible.

The "there" is illuminated in such a way that the "luminosity" of the "there" is such that the visible "light" of the human horizon is obscured. We have always, in accordance with the meaning of the constitution of the disclosedness of the there, understood the "there" in the sense of the "luminosity" of the "world." This means that the "there" is actually illuminated, that is, it is "there" in the mode of the visible light of day and the brightness of the "sun."

## § 2. Everydayness of the There

The interpretation of the universe as a whole first makes clear that the phenomenon of the universe is a "transcendental one" and that its "substance" is derived from it. The conceptual discovery of the transcendental character of the "world"-that is, the desire for a transcendental meaning of the being of the being which we call Dasein-has brought us before the true ontological meaning of the substance of the being of Dasein, which we showed to be care. As a being which is concerned in its being about its ownmost potentiality-of-being, care can be understood phenomenally only if the being of Dasein has been already discovered. Care itself is a potentiality-of-being which, as being-in-the-world, has to be factically existent.

The ontological meaning of the phenomenon of care can thus be primordially clarified by considering the being-in-the-world of Dasein, that is, the potentiality-of-being of Dasein. We shall also show that care is not an arbitrary and factically determined phenomenon which is then isolated from the everyday. Rather, care is the condition of the possibility of the possibilities of being-in-the-world. We shall also show that the ontological clarification of the phenomenon of care presupposes a fundamental orientation to the ontological and existential concept of the "world."

We set forth the idea of a "world" as a basis for the consideration of the being of Dasein. But the world is also the disclosedness of the there. We shall characterize the disclosedness of the world as care. Our analysis of the disclosedness of the world has shown that the disclosedness of the world belongs to the constitution of being of Dasein. We have also made clear that care is the existentiality of the there. But the existential interpretation of the world must also take into consideration the constitution of the being of the there.

Above all, we must make clear the existential meaning of the everydayness of the there.

## § 3. The Existential Constitution of the There

The analysis of the fundamental structures of the there, and especially the existential construction of the total historical constitution of the there, has made clear that the existential structure of the world is grounded in temporality [Temporalitat]. The existentiality of the world was previously undetermined. But just as it became clear that the total historical constitution of the there was not yet complete, and that a preliminary interpretation of the everydayness of the there was necessary, we also made clear that the ontological characterization of the total historical constitution of the there was not at all self-evident.

The ontological interpretation of the total historical constitution of the there has revealed, however, that the existence of the temporality of the everydayness of the there is a primordial phenomenon whose kind of being is also prefigured by the totality of temporality in general. The ontological characterization of the totality of temporality as such has provided the basis for bringing the complete structural content of care, that is, the existential meaning of the totality of the structural whole, into the existential concept of the totality of temporality. With the further explicitness of the existential analysis of the totality of the structural whole, we have an ontological mandate to carry through the preparatory existential interpretation of the everydayness of the there.

## § 4. Everydayness and the Everydayness of the There

The analysis of the totality of the structural whole of Dasein has made it clear that the "there" is constituted existentially by attunement and discourse. Everydayness is not the there only if and when the there is "subjective." "Subjective" is merely structurally different in kind from "objectively chosen." But indeed, in the latter, the choice is not objectively present so much as it is "subjective," but is obtainable only by setting forth some objectively present fact of Dasein.

The fact of this "subjective" availability of the there is not a factically objectively present property of the there, but the "there" is neither objectively present nor just "there" in an objectively present way. Insofar as the being of Dasein is concerned about its there, and in this way understands it, it must first be able to discover the "there" in order "to be able to destroy it." This must first be shown with regard to the kind of being of the being [Sein] which is there.

The everydayness of the there is not to be understood in contradistinction to a concrete mode of the there and its constitution. Everydayness is rather grounded in the temporality of the they. The temporality of the there is not a factical fact. Everydayness is not grounded in a factical being of Dasein.

## § 5. The Basic Character of the Event Horizon of Dasein

We characterized the formation of the typical "way of seeing" in an earlier period as the direct and simple interaction of two things. This direct and simple interaction is now called the "way of taking care of things." In the use of the word "taking care," ontology has not yet come to grips with the fact that in this way the vulgar interpretation of the phenomenon of care might also say that the interpretation of the specific being [Sein] of Dasein had to be more primordial. Thus the vulgar interpretation of the everyday mode of being of Dasein and the way in which it is initially and for the most part imposed could be combined.

The ontological interpretation of the everyday mode of being of Dasein could then more primordially determine the meaning of the vulgar concept of care. But this vulgar concept of care cannot be used ontologically as a basis for the ontological problematic. On the contrary.

As long as the meaning of the "presupposing" is not clarified ontologically, we can say in principle that in the ground of the vulgar concept of care the relation between the self and the world is ontologically undetermined. But then the ontological problematic itself turns into a problematic of the kind which is still prevalent in the eighteenth century: How does it stand with the being of the "natural" ["eigentliche"]. The vulgar concept of care is not adequate ontologically for the ontological problematic. As long as the meaning of the vulgar concept of care is not clarified, the ontological interpretation of the everyday mode of being of Dasein is also not able to recognize the existential structure of the phenomenon.

The question about Being is not a trivial question. It is a fundamental question. It has held sway for more than a thousand years. It even prefigured the development of Western philosophy up to Kant. Kant, who held onto the traditional meaning of the word, realized that this question was no trivial question at all, but a fundamental one.

The question about Being no longer has its ground in a particular era and place. It arose in the midst of the most extraordinary circumstances and situations, in the midst of a certain decline in the historical Dasein of the Greeks.

But if our earlier approach to the question of Being was correct, then we must also recognize that this question was posed in the most extraordinary circumstances and situations, and that the decisive decision regarding the fundamental meaning of Being was never reached in this questioning.

The question about Being has not yet found a place in the established order of the fundamental structures of Western Dasein. It is not clear where it stands with the question about the essence of Being as such. This is not surprising, since this question, in our fundamental orientation, has an essential connection with the question about Being as a whole. But where does it stand? This very question, which has already won the day for Kant, is now being asked in a completely different and more fundamental way. We are asking about the essence of Being. We are asking about the Being of beings. But we are also asking about Being in general. In this question we are rejecting the prior question about Being. But this means that we are eliminating the prior question from the outset. We are asking about the Being of beings.

But are we doing this merely to eliminate the question? Are we not making the fundamental mistake of overlooking the question altogether? Are we not forcing the question into a position where it fails to find and determine its ground? Are we not forcing the question into a position where it cannot even get to the question?

The question about Being is a fundamental one. It is the first question among others that we must pose if we are to gain the fundamental insight necessary to get beyond this question, and to set the fundamental course for the future question concerning Being? But this question is the first question in the order of genuine philosophical questioning, and first among the questions that comes first in the order of philosophical questioning in the whole of Western philosophy.

The question about Being is the first question in the order of genuine philosophical questioning. It stands first among the questions that have been posed up to this question-of-Being and the questions that follow it.

But we can now see that the question about Being is not without justification. After all, it is the first question in the order of genuine philosophical questioning. The question about Being is by no means trivial. It has been discussed in the question-How does it stand with Being as a whole?-and concerns the foundations of Western philosophy from the start. We can ascertain this, however, only if we now bring the question <Üstemmeling, stem of Being, stem of wesend> into the scope of our question.

But we have not yet gained an adequate grasp of the question about Being, or at least of the ground that we have gained. We may have discussed it in great detail, but at the outset discussed only the preliminary question <ÜWhy are there beings at all instead of nothing?> That was all. As regards the question, however, we are now asking what use is this question if we do not even get to the question? For now, let us pass our time. We can still ask questions about the question. We can even discuss it more directly. We have come this far in discussing the question

## § 6. The Ontological Problem of the Everydayity of Dasein*

It is often said that everydayness is the condition of the possibility that Dasein can be brought to exist as a being. Everydayness then makes possible the everyday mode of being of Dasein; and thus the ontological problematic is bound to the existential and ontological problematic which has made the phenomenon of care ontically comprehensible. The ontological problematic has made us clear that an ontological interpretation of everydayness is not a being-with-one-another within the world which is later understood ontically. Rather, the ontological problematic has to do with the being of the being that is in fact "primordially" our Dasein, that is, the being that we understand as "we."

The ontological problematic has made us see how the constitution of being of Dasein is dependent upon the constitution of being of these beings themselves. The ontological interpretation of everydayness must now show whether the everyday mode of being of Dasein can be construed as a way of being toward the "world" or whether an ontically appropriate way of being is to be required.

As opposed to the vulgar interpretation of the everydayness of Dasein, we have now attained the possibility of developing the existential concept of everydayness in a definite way. We must now show that the everyday mode of being of Dasein is a way of being-in-the-world. For the ontological interpretation, the way in which everydayness is to be understood is by no means obvious. We have to do with the ontological structure of everydayness itself. We have to show that everydayness is not simply a property of some being which we encounter in the surrounding world, but rather a way of being itself.'

## § 7. The Existential Structure of the Circumstance

The existential and ontological interpretation of everydayness is a fundamental problem for the vulgar interpretation of Dasein. But the interpretation of the everydayness of Dasein is not the only one.

Just as the existentiality of the being of Dasein is no less than the ontological one, the everydayness of Dasein is also not everything. Everydayness is not the sum of the everydayness of Dasein. Everydayness can be a mode of the being of Dasein. But does not everydayness thus include the possibility of the occurrence of Dasein? If everyday Dasein is indeed existentielly an ontologically defined being, and if its nature is essentially constituted by temporality, does not the occurrence of everydayness then also include the occurrence of the "world"? If everyday Dasein is indeed not an ontically definite way of being, does not its being then already lie in a definite world? Does not this being-in-the-world of Dasein, which we call everydayness, lie in the world? And does not this being-in-the-world of Dasein in which everydayness is concerned with the "traditional" dasein of Dasein exist in a way which is ontologically different from the being of the "obsessed," that is, the there?

## § 8. The Instantaneousity of the Instinct for Thinking and Recognizing the Unseen [Zuwandel]

In the phenomenon of consciousness we are looking for an immediate and complete closure [Abwandelheit]. What is the origin of this closeness [Abwandelheit?] and of the existentiality of the phenomenon?

We already explained in the very first analysis of Being that the being to be clarified is the same in its essential structures as Being itself. But in order to see the phenomenon of consciousness in its very being, we first have to look at the being of Being itself, with all its structural formations, the structure of which we call the "essence."

In its very structure of utterance and understanding, Being is able to gather from itself what is being said [Verstimmung]. The substance of what is said is not already there, it itself, but rather it is already in what is said. But this "what is in-itself" ["Wossein"]. It is not only nothing, but the "self." Only the kind of Being that is already in the statement that is in being-in-itself ("in-itself") can gather "what is in-itself." The "what is in-itself" ["Wos-sein"] is not an existentielement [Abwandelheit] that can be "cured" in the sense of a temporary forgetting. This kind of "curing" does not arise from the fact that the in-itself of what is said is nothing, nor does it arise from the possibility of a temporary "presupposing" that is necessary for "presupposing" that what is said can be what will be spoken. What is in-itself at the same time has the structural structure of a potentiality [Pseinte in Sein]. It is possible for this being to come "toward us" as "truth" [Sache] only in an existentiell way of a factitious kind, that is, in such a way that we cannot justifiably "claim" it in a "for-the-sake-of-which."

Thus, we must attempt to clarify the phenomenon of Truth in an existential and temporal sense in order to obtain an understanding of the existentiality of the phenomenon of Truth and of its connection to that of Being.

The phenomena of the being of truth and that of Being together constitute the being of this being. Being-in is only a mode of its being constitutive of the being of the "I in general." And this "selfsameness of the I" is possible, as is the being of all beings.

The primordiality [Unverwegenheit], which belongs to Being, makes it the "ground" of our investigation. It also makes clear that its ownmost existentiality can provide the necessary guidance for our analysis of some characteristic aspects of questioning and self-reflection. The possibility of individuation or factional-representational unity is also possible. What is "ground" for these possibilities is the phenomenon indicated in sec. 1, the being of truth.

At the same time, we must understand that our "presupposing" the I and its "factical" unity is precisely the fundamental condition of the possibility of discovering an understanding of Being. The possibility of discovering the Being that already belongs to the I, which we call the "essence," is possible only in the possibility of "making this presupposing" [Umhafte].

The essential existentiality and specificity of taking care of Being constitutes the temporality [Umwsorgen] of this phenomenon. Thus by constituting the constitution of Being in the sense of the temporality of Taking Care we shall show how temporality, that is, care and being-in-itself, are determined by a primordiality in the ground of the being of beings at the time their constitution of Being is disclosed.

It is difficult to describe in words how deeply rooted this kind of being is. To begin with, it is a "surprising" and "indeed wonderful" kind of being. We are "surrounded" by it. And we also often see it "only on the inside." We also never quite understand how and why this being is so "obvious." The fact that we are "surrounded" by it, the fact that it is "obvious" to every being, does not, however, mean that we do not understand it. On the contrary, it is only at first an outside-of-one-another within-the-world. We are not familiar with it. It is "obvious" to us, but not at all freed for it. It is not something that we merely encounter, but it is "obvious" to us in order to survive.

But with this kind of being, "obvious" is not the same as "extremely obvious." Although we immediately say that "obvious" at one glance, this "obviousness" must be understood in the sense of an angle of the moon. We can see it clearly as the moon rises behind the clouds. We can also see it even more clearly as a "very slight" moon with a "perfect" moon-rise behind it.

But if in this moon-rise and in this seeming brightness something "obvious" is also also there, then what is "obvious" by no means penetrates to the ground. What is "obvious" is such a way of seeing that it can be overcome by a moon-rise or by a sunrise. What is "obvious" initially and for the most part is an orientation in a way that is not obviated by the moon's "light."

What does it mean, "the moon rises"? In our circumspect acquaintance with the "obvious," we only say that it rises. The moon, in our eyes, is always already the most beautiful and "obvious" thing in the sky. We see it as a bright, silvery object with a distance of about a thousand kilometers from the earth. We do not even need a telescope to see it. It is an object that is already objectively present in the heavens. The moon is the "lightening" of the "surrounding world." We know that the moon "falls" behind the earth, but not because the earth moves behind the moon, but because the earth moves with the moon, as a "passing through" it. The moon is the "surrounding world" as such, a "worldlike" being.

In the "obviousness" of the moon, the moon-rise is not an elevation of the surrounding world, but the being of the moon "surrounding" that world, but "obstructing" it, is already in being with it. "Objectively present" in the heavens, the earth moves in the space "between" the sun and the moon. The earth is not "subjectively" "in" the heavens. It is "obviously" in the heavens, but not as the "object" of an "objective" view. The "obviousness" of the moon does not first originate from the moon "obscured" by the visibility of the surroundings, the earth is also not objectively present in the heavens, but only "obviously" in the moon. The earth is indeed "obviously" in the heavens, but not as the "object" of an objective way of looking at the "earth."

But, then, only the "obvious" is "subjective." What is the basis for this "subjective" being "obviously" in the heavens? Is this not an ontological problem? The moon "lasts" in the heavens. Does this not mean that the moon is objectively present "in" the heavens, and that only a being that is objectively present "lasts" at all?

But the "obviousness" of the moon is not the sole possible "obviousness." The heavens "obviously" also "observed" the moon, and yet the moon was not understood in the same way. The moon, in terms of its "obviousness," was understood "obviously" at the same time as the sky "observed" the lightening of the moon. But only because the moon is obeyed "obviously" does it show itself at all. The moon shows itself as an "obvious object" that "obviously" also "obstinacy" is based upon; and the obstinacy of the moon is not based upon the fact that it has a diameter that is "objectively" not objectively present, but is based upon the fact that it is obeyed "objectively" for the simple reason that it is understood exactly as the "moon" that is.

## § 9. The Existential Interpretation of Dasein as Care

The statement indicated that, "but for now... [Curend] is in the point of no return." This statement expresses the position of the "but for now" which is implied in the existential and historical constitution of Dasein. In accordance with its existential meaning, this statement cannot be modified or restricted. But the statement also expresses a wish of being fulfilled in the possibility of any Dasein. This fulfillment was signified by the expression "in order to see" (nicht sich das Sein) as used in the statement. The intention of the existential and historical constitution of Dasein understood in the statement is to give back to Dasein its "connection to what can be taken care of" and to give the structure of care, as such, its certain "presupposing."

The statement "but for now... is in the point of no return" is intended solely and primarily as a saying of the "but for now" that is understood in the taking care that understands. The saying "but for now" has the character of a saying "ahead-of-itself," "for-the-sake-of-which," as well as the structure of a saying "ahead-of-itself." The existential, historical "but for-the-sake-of-itself" expresses the being of existing Dasein. But in saying this, Dasein does not declare itself as an existentiell being. To declare itself as such, Dasein must first be "made aware." The existential, historic "but for-the-sake-of-itself" is the only way to make Dasein exist as being-ahead-of-oneself.

The statement "but for now..." is defined in the imperative, verb, and preposition. Intention is addressed to the being (Dasein) itself, and conversely. We shall investigate the principal determinations of intention in order to gain a better appreciation of the formal nature of the determinations of intention that express themselves in the word "but."

The basic forms of the word "but" are "so" and "so that." But in the subordination of the determinations of intention to the idea of future and the constancy of the present, a mistake is made. When we use the words "but" as a substantive, the "but" has the character of an intention, not a designation of beings with regard to their state in relation to which the being in question is concerned, unless, in relation to this being [Seiende], it is modified by a verb. But even the simple "but" is not an indefinite indefinite negation of the idea of the future? If the "not yet" is understood as the lack of a definite "but," the negation shows itself as an indefinite lack in the modification of the idea of the future and of the constancy of the present.

## § 10. The Structural Character of the Meaning of Being in General

The above analysis of the meaning of being in general had the following result: the term meaning signifies the totality of the structural whole of Dasein. This totality is constituted in the constitution of being-in-the-world, and encompasses the common, everyday meaning of being. The expression meaning signifies the complete revealedness of the there, which is then further to the side. The meaning of being is the totality of the structural whole of Dasein. Meaning signifies the totality of the structural whole of the whole of Dasein. In seeking the meaning of being, we must constantly understand that the meaning of being always concerns the whole of being-in-the-world. However, this whole [Sein] is constantly and in each instance already held together by way of a common tether that nonetheless does not restrict the meaning of being in general to what is present at hand.

Thus, we can say that meaning is a way of being of the totality of the structural whole of Dasein. It is the being [Seiende] "that" ["gibt"]. This meaning belongs to the everydayness of Dasein, and it is the everyday way in which Dasein "beholds" the world. We also know that the everydayness of Dasein is transformed when the "cogito sum" [cf. § 69] is brought along. The everydayness of Dasein does not consist in the mere presence of the cogito, but the cogito is in the service of the everyday.

The meaning of being is the everydayness [Umsicht] of Dasein. But the everydayness of Dasein is then grounded in a temporality that, as a mode of the structural whole, is also the mode of the temporalizing of temporality. The everydayness of the surrounding world is grounded in a temporalizing of temporality that in its turn is a mode of the temporalizing of temporality. But is it a coincidence that the existential meaning of being, the meaning of a being that is present [vollendein] in the factical world, should be determined by the phenomena that we have placed in the foreground of our analyses?

What is the ground [Sicht] of the possibility that the meaning of being can be understood in the sense of the meaning of being? What we have set forth-the fact that being is not an empty word-can only point back to the beings that are already at hand in the surrounding world. The being that we encounter in this world is constituted in the constitution of temporality. We must show the concrete mode of the temporalization of temporality in the "spatially" constitutive relations of the there. If we are to make intelligible the meaning of being in general, we must be able to set forth beings which are in every way as the ontic and ontological equivalent of the thing which is present in the world. In the temporalizing of temporality, "time" is no longer completely a priori. The horizon of the horizon of the things we encounter within the world has become so far removed from the mundane that the time taken care of in taking care of a being has, at the same time, the meaning of being of that being. The things at hand in the surrounding world are not yet "past" in the sense of the "past the history of their making" or of the "past the life of their needfulness." But then, the time taken care of is still not completely determinate. We can understand it this way only if we grasp the fundamental ontological problematic of the way the ontological structure of the world has been interpreted up to now, and in what sense.

The vulgar interpretation of the "spatially" comprehensible has relegated the meaning of being to the realm of the indefinite. Left to themselves, they have missed the meaning of being in general. However, this can be remedied only if the meaning of being is understood at all-that is, if being is understood as the ontological condition of the possibility of beings that are at hand or present for us. If we understand being in the sense of the being of beings present in the world, and if this being in the sense of self-interpretation is conceived in a way different from the vulgar one, then the vulgar interpretation of the meaning of being will not be able to recognize the meaning of being at all. But it will understand itself and be concomitantly concomitantly affected by this understanding. The vulgar interpretation of the meaning of being is not only erroneous in its mode of interpretation of the being present of beings, it also covers over ontically the ontological meaning of the vulgar interpretation of the meaning of being.

## § 11. The Meaning of Being Transmitted to us by the Tree 

What do we mean when we say that what we encounter within the world is "in our" way "in our" way? How is this being [Sein] in general to be understood? How is the being of the other beings encountered in their innerworldliness to be understood? We are constantly asking about the "in which" beings are "in our" being, that is, we are constantly looking for a way to be in this way. But where do we find this "in which" to be found? In the example of the fig tree (Jugend), we say that it is in the "between" of its two branches in the forest. This circumstance only means that we are constantly encountering the fig tree as if it were a living thing. We are constantly "in the between" our two "fruits" and we are constantly leaving them behind. This between-nature is what is initially accessible within the world. This between-nature itself does not turn into a mere "between-two-fruits" of the same kind of being, but rather into the other way around: it is the other way around because it is not the case that both the "between" and the "between" are "merely" the same.

We always encounter the fig tree as having two kinds of "in which" it is: that within which it grows and that which it eats. Our daily and hourly experience of the fig tree makes clear that it is "in the between." But the "between" is not one and the same for all. The between-animity of the twofold "between" is that only those beings which are "in between" are able to be encountered. The between-animity of the twofold "between" is not opposed to the other way around. In the between-themselves, beings are encountered as what is "between" them, that is, as beings that are also "between" the two "fruits." This between-themselves is not the case only when we see the fruit "between" the two "fruits." At the same time beings are encountered within the forest, for the fig tree "in the woods" is in the forest.

The between-nature of the twofold "between" is that of the fig tree, that is, of the surrounding landscape. The within-between is what is objectively present within the world. This in-between itself is what is understood by the term "world." But this between-themselves is not just an existence that is constituted by the world. The "between" is a mode of the relevant significance of the world. The between-themselves is what is understood by the term world. The fig tree is the figment of a "world" that is "in the ground" of the world. The in-between is what is initially accessible. The between-themselves, however, is not a being "between" two rather two objectively present things. The between-themselves is always already the in-between.

Thus only the fig tree, being the figment of a world that is "in the ground" of the world, is at all. The other beings are not. These beings are likewise not. But even if these beings are, they can never be as they are.

For the fig tree is the "fruit," it is the res corporea, the "tree." The res corporea is the being of the "tree" in the broadest sense. But the broadest meaning of the res corporea includes the vastness of space. The vastness of space is so vast that it covers the whole of the world. The vastness of the space that covers the whole of the world is, however, not the same as the vastness of the world. The vastness of the world is, instead, the spatiality of the world. The vastness of the world is not spatialized into worldspace.

But the vastness of the world is also not a mere fact of the spatiality of the spatial relations of spatial beings. The broadest, most primordial, and the most adequate interpretation of the constitution of worldliness encompasses the structure of being of all beings "in the world." This "in the world" is constituted by the existential "worldliness." The term worldliness is used in the broadest sense when one means the being-in-the-world of a being that belongs to the world and to the worldliness of the world. Worldliness itself is then understood in the sense of world. The expressions worldliness and worldliness express the existential meaning of world.

Dasein, which is concerned in its being about this being, is always already "in the world" as the being that it is.
